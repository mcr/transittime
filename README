TransitTime is a RUBY-Maemo (GTK) application that helps you keep
track of which transit routes are better than others.

It will run on a portable device (such as a Nokia N800/N810), and
collect information on when your favorite bus/trains/go-carts arrive
(compared to when they are scheduled).  

It will collect your favorite routes and let you share that information
with others through a TBD set of social networking sites.  This is a form
of CrowdComputing applied to the problem of:
	"how do I get from A to B?"

Integration with Google Maps is anticipated, but we don't know how yet.

Maybe you have a better name.  I hear MC Hammer singing in the background.
"You *can* touch this", as he points to his tablet...
